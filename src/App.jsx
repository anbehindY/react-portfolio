					Hello, my name is Yan Min Thwin, you can also call me Alfie. I'm a full-stack developer proficient in React, Redux, TailwindCSS and Ruby on Rails. Previously, I was a medical student studying at the University of Medicine (1) in Myanmar. During the COVID-19 pandemic, all the universities were shut down, and since then I started to learn programming and decided to switch my career completely.
Iâ€™m currently pair-programming with remote professionals from all over the world through the Microverse program. I recently built a website for a local clinic where patients can view the list of doctors with their details, and where patients can make a reservation for their needs. I really enjoy building beautiful websites with efficient features and I believe such kinds of websites will bring the audience wherever we want to.
